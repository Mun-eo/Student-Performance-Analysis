# Student Performance Analysis

This project utilizes performance data on exam results for students in grades 9 through 12 to uncover relationships between academic behavior and exam scores

**Insights to uncover**
1. Is there a correlation between attendance and exam scores?
2. Is there a correlation between study hours per day and exam scores?
3. Is there a correlation between learning method and exam scores?
4. Is there a correlation between smartphone usage and exam scores?

<h2>Understanding the dataset:</h2>

This project was simulated using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance collected from kaggle. The dataset consisted of 1470 rows of employee information. The information within the dataset highlights their info such as age, gender, job role, job level, commute distance etc. Alongside their performance and self rated satisfaction with their job and environment at the company. The tools used for this project were SQL to collect the data needed for the descriptive analysis, and Tableau to create visualizations and build a dashboard to provide clear insights on where is attrition happening within synthetix solutions and what demographics are contributing to the attrition.
